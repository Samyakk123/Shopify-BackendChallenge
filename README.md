- Swagger link (REST API Documentation): https://shopifybackendchallenge.herokuapp.com/api-docs/

# ðŸ’» Technologies used

- MERN Stack (MongoDb, Express.js, React, Node.js)
- Mongoose (ODM for MongoDb, To create schemas and validate information)
- JavaScript
- Swagger (API Documentation)
- Heroku

# ðŸ’¡ Implementation Details

- Since MongoDb doesn't enforce document structure, I decided to utilize **mongoose** to create concrete schemas with constraints perform easy adn effective validation checking, adn easier querying/filtering which provided very beneficial when implementing the CRUD functionalities
- I decided to use **Swagger** to create interactive API documentation for users to directly test out my backend endpoints alongside seeing their input values and formatting (however, you can also use another tool such as Postman)
- I also decided to deploy my project on **Heroku** so that the entire tedious process of running it locally as mentioned below could be avoided. This allows for anyone to easily access the website and test out my program

# ðŸš© Requirements
